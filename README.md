# BGG-boardgame-analysis
Exploratory Analysis of the Boardgamegeek.com (aka BGG) Top-5000 Boardgames.
Boardgame names, ratings, weights + several other features were scraped using the BGG API. The resulting data was cleaned and exploratory data analysis was performed.
Out of curiosity, I wanted to find out how the number of games, their weight, and the most popular categories have changed over time and get a rough idea about the key ingredients for a good board game today using an appropriate regression model. Here are some findings that I found interesting.
