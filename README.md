# BGG-boardgame-analysis
Exploratory Analysis of the Boardgamegeek.com (aka BGG) Top-5000 Board games.
Board game names, ratings, weights + several other features were scraped using the BGG API. The resulting data was cleaned and some light exploratory data analysis was performed. I was particularly curious to see how the number of games published, their weight, and the most popular categories have changed over time. I also wanted to get a rough idea about the key ingredients for a good board game today using an appropriate regression model. Here are some findings that I found interesting.
